# My Portfolio

**Live Site:** [MyPortfolio](https://dev-jlagunas.github.io/my-portfolio/)

This is my jr developer portfolio site. It was created using Vue 3, Javascript, and styled with Tailwind CSS. The user interface is simple but vibrant. I paid special attention to
the user experience. I strived towards making the site easy to understand and navigate around while providing information in a efficient way. The site also has features such as dark/light modes, and is multi-lingual. Users may navigate in English, Spanish, and Japanese which are 3 languages I use. Furthermore, the site is responsive on all screen sizes.

## Features

- **Multi-lingual:** The portfolio site supports multiple languages, allowing users to switch between English, Spanish, and Japanese.
- **Responsive Design:** Designed to look and function well on all devices and across a wide range of screen sizes.
- **Beautiful User Interface:** I just really like the way the project ended up looking.
- **Built with Vue and Tailwind CSS:** I used Vue.js framework for dynamic and reactive components, and styled with Tailwind CSS for efficient and modular CSS design..
- **Modern Web Technologies:** Built with Vue, SCSS, and Tailwind CSS for a seamless and responsive user interface.
- **Modular Project Structure:** The project is highly modular, making it easy to maintain, update, and extend. Components are well-organized, promoting reusability and scalability.
- **Dark/Light Modes:** Intuitive navigation with a sidebar menu that allows users to easily switch between different planet pages.
- **Accessible:** The site follows best practices in web accessibility, ensuring that all users, including those with disabilities, can navigate and interact with the content.
- **Semantic HTML:** I made sure to use semantic HTML elements to provide better structure and meaning to the web content, improving SEO and accessibility..
- **Original Digital Art:** I created original self digital portraits of myself for which I am proud.
